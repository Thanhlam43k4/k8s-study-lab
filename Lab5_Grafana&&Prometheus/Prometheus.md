Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and latering toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user communicty. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.

To emphazise this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the `CNCF` Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project after kubernetes.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which is was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
